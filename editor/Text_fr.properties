# Property file used to internationalize (i18n) the text editor application
# for the English (en) language.
# To translate for another language, leave the strings before the =
# alone, since they are used as keys by the program, and translate the
# strings after the =.  Feel free to add extra comments (lines
# starting with #).  I suppose you could translate the comments if you
# like; the main effect would be that someone who understands your
# language but not English could translate your file into a third language.
#
# The default Text.properties is currently a copy of the _en file.
#
# Menus and actions
# Each menu item has
#   name.text=	String to use to label the menu item. 
#   name.mnemonic=
#		Single-character string to use as a mnemonic.
#		Swing will underline the *first* occurrence in name.text
#		of whatever character you use. 
#   name.tip=	"short description" string to use as a short "tool tip" when
#               the user lets the mouse hover over the menu item
#   name.icon=	name of a .gif or .jpg file to display as an icon for
#		this menu item.  These icons are displayed beside the
#		name of the menu item, but also placed in a toolbar.
#		Thus be conservative in setting icons; only those menu
#		items that you want to have in the tool bar should
#		have icons.  Don't bother translating these lines -
#		the icon names correspond to file names, so don't
#		appear directly in anything that end-users see.
#   name.help=	A code for giving context-sensitive help.  These do
#		not need to be translated;  they are in the properties
#		file only so that we don't have to recompile the
#		progam as we grow the help files; initially, few of
#		these items have help text.
#   name.accel=	Keystroke to use as a keyboard accelerator.
#		Normally these should be in KeyBindings.properties
#   name.desc=	"long description" suggested by the Java documentation as a
#               suitable context-sensitive help
